## üåç Language Settings - How It Really Works

### The Reality of Speech Recognition

**Important:** Speech recognition technology has limitations that we address honestly:

#### ‚úÖ What Works (AI Response Speech)
- **Automatic Language Detection**: AI responses are automatically detected and spoken in the correct language
- **Smart Voice Selection**: System automatically chooses the best voice for each language
- **Real-time Switching**: AI can respond in different languages as needed

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Requires Manual Setup (Your Speech Input)
- **Manual Language Selection**: You must select your speaking language before starting conversation mode
- **No Auto-Detection for Input**: Speech recognition cannot automatically detect what language you're speaking
- **Single Language Mode**: You can only speak in one language at a time (the one you selected)

### Why This Limitation Exists

The Web Speech Recognition API requires the language to be specified **before** listening begins. If you speak Spanish while the system expects English, it will produce poor transcripts. This is a fundamental limitation of current browser technology, not our implementation.
